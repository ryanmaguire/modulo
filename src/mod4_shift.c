 *      Computes mod 4 of an integer.                                         *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *

 *          An integer, the integer we want the mod 4 value of.               *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      n_mod_4 (unsigned int):                                               *
 *          The input integer reduced mod 4.                                  *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Use bit-shifting to compute multiplication and division. By shifting  *
 *      the input two slots to the right, and then multiplying by 4, we will  *
 *      zero out the first two bits on the number. Subtracting this value     *
 *      from the input leaves only the last two bits of the input, which is   *
 *      the equivalent of n mod 4.                                            *
