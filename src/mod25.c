 *  Function:                                                                 *

 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Computes mod 25 of an integer the fast way.                           *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *
 *      n (unsigned int):                                                     *
 *          An integer, the integer we want the mod 25 value of.              *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      n_mod_25 (unsigned int):                                              *
 *          The input integer reduced mod 25.                                 *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Use the magic number 2748779070, which is the ceiling of 2^36 / 25.   *
 *      By multiplying n by this, and then shifting 36 bits down, we will     *
 *      have efficiently computed integer division for n / 25. By subtracting *
 *      25 times this value from the input we will have n mod 25.             *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      This function assumes unsigned long long support is available and     *
 *      that int and long long are 32 and 64 bits, respectively.              *
 *                                                                            *
 *      This method is outlined in the book "Hacker's Delight."               *
